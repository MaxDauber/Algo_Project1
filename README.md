# Algorithms & Complexity Project1
Implementation of Gale Shapley Algorithm for finding stable matchings between servers and users, as well as a brute force check to see if a given matching is stable.

Driver.java is the main driver program. Use command line arguments to choose between brute force and the G-S algorithm and to specify an input file. Use -b for brute force, -g for the G-S algorithm, and input file name for specified input (i.e. java -classpath . Driver [-g] [-b] <filename> on a linux machine). 
  
```python
java Driver -b -g /path/to/provided/inputs/
```
